Welcome to CreativeCanvas, where I showcase my journey as a beginner web designer. Exploring design, functionality, and innovation to create captivating web experiences. Let's connect and bring your ideas to life!

# Portfolio Challenge

## Overview

This is my submission for the Unit 2 Portfolio Challenge. The challenge involves creating a portfolio page that showcases my web development skills. The portfolio serves as a platform to display my projects and highlights the thought processes behind them.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, I've applied core skills learned during the course, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables, to create a responsive portfolio page. The page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. The navigation allows users to scroll to specific sections, and the "Work" section contains titled images of my applications, with the first application's image being larger. Users can click on the application images to access the deployed applications. Additionally, the layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.
The appearance and functionality of the web application closely resemble the provided mock-up. I've customized the colours and images to personalize the design.

Please feel free to explore my portfolio and thank you for reviewing my work!

Best regards,

Claire Fraser
